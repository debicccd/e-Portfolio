										<h3>Unit 1, Collaborative Discussion #1</h3>
										<p>For this assignment each student was tasked with choosing an example of unethical design practice and showing examples of ethical guidelines they violated.</p>
										<p>In my discussion I outlined the deceptive practices of 'Dark UX Patterns' and why they are unethical.</p>

							<h2>RMPP Major Deliverables</h2>
							<div class="items style1 big onscroll-fade-in">
								<section>
									<h3>Literature Review</h3>
									<p>For the literature review I was tasked with choosing a topic from a list of approved topics, then critically evaluating that topic by reading existing literature on the subject.</p>
									<p>Main objectives<br>
									   1. Provide an overview of current knowledge<br>
									   2. Demonstrate awareness<br>
									   3. Higlight similar and constrasting views</p>
									<p>The topic I choose to cover for my literature review was AI and machine learning in the field of assisting the physically disabled. I went over the history of AI and machine learning, the basics of how it works, and how it can be used to help those who are disabled. Many studies and research projects have already been performed on the topic, but there is a lot more room for the field to grow and improve.</p>

									<h3>Research Proposal Presentation</h3>
									<p>For this deliverable I was required to pick a topic and propose a research project to expand on that topic. This proposal would be delivered as a presentation and needed a visual component and an audio recording to acompany it.</p>
									<p>Main Objectives<br>
									   1. Knowledge of the topic and use of relevant sources<br>
									   2. Critical analysis of the topic<br>
									   3. Well-structured proposal<br>
									   4. Competently executed presentation</p>
									   <p>My topic of choice again involved AI and machine learning, but applied to the field of Cybersecurity. I proposed that the addition of machine learning could enhance the security and reliability of traditional biometric scanners. My research project would test this hypothesis by both modifying an existing biometric scanner with AI and by making a new software to track eye movement with machine learning.</p>

							<h2>RMPP Individual Reflection</h2>
							<p>This module focused on several important topics that are important to cybersecurity. These topics include research methods, ethical considerations and codes of conduct, data analysis, and legal issues. Focusing on ethics and legal issues is important because they factor into almost everything that happens in a professional setting, and too many people take a hands-off approach to it, assuming that it’s someone else’s job to inform them about any potential problems. By focusing on these issues it stimulates an unconscious process to always be thinking about potential ethical or legal conflicts and bring them to attention when necessary. Research is another important area for almost any professional. It’s impossible to learn everything you need to know before starting a job, and the ability to identify when your knowledge of a topic is lacking and how to gain that knowledge through asking colleagues and independent research is invaluable.</p>
							<p>The literature review was the first major deliverable of the module. The focus of the paper was teaching how to research a specific topic and critically evaluate and discuss the information found. The topic I chose to focus on was AI and machine learning helping the physically disabled. The majority of my research was done by reading research papers and textbooks found online. I outlined a brief history of AI and machine learning and the basics of how they function and are implemented. I then went over several different ways machine learning was being used to improve the quality of life of the physically disabled. There are several complications to the use of machine learning in the medical field, so I discussed them next. This includes ethical considerations and complications due to the inherent drawbacks of deep learning AI. I believe the field of AI and machine learning has a lot of potential for helping advance a lot of fields of study, and assisting those who need medical help is very important.</p>
							<p>The next major deliverable was the research project proposal. The learning objectives of this presentation were researching a topic, compiling that research into a plan for a research project, and then presenting that plan in a clear and interesting way. I chose a topic related to the subject of my literature review, AI and machine learning, but applied it to the field of cybersecurity. I proposed adding machine learning to traditional methods of biometric security standards with the hypothesis that the addition of deep learning could help improve the security and usability of biometric scans. In my presentation I started with the history of biometrics and how they were incorporated into security and cybersecurity applications. I then outlined how the research project would add machine learning to an existing biometric system and then test that system to see if it had improved. I also referenced some research already completed that showed the concept had promise in increasing security and reliability. I also talked about a new idea to use machine learning in a new type of cybersecurity software that monitored eye movement and keyboard use to identify unauthorized users. Next I presented a timeline of the research project from the recording of data to training of machine learning algorithms to testing and refinement and gathering of results. Another critical part of the research proposal were ethical considerations. Due to the sensitive nature of recording biometric data of research participants, ethical codes of conduct and privacy laws need to be closely followed during every step of the research project.</p>
							<p>It took me a lot of deliberation to decide on a topic for the research proposal. Choosing a topic for big projects has always been difficult for me because I start second guessing my ideas and if they will have enough content to fill a large project. I’m glad that I chose the topic that I did because it was very interesting to look at the existing research, and both parts of the topic (machine learning and cybersecurity) are areas that I think are full of potential for future research and improvement. The other difficult part of the project was recording the presentation. Oral speaking has always been something I struggle with. Having the ability to go back and re-record slides that I messed up on made it a lot easier than a live presentation, but it’s still something that I need to practice more.</p>
							<p>Overall this was an interesting and informative module. When I learned about ethics in my undergraduate studies it was usually in a separate humanities course. Learning about ethics alongside technical aspects leads to a better understanding of them. I also appreciate more practice writing and presenting a proposal because it involves several things I’m weak at, so the more I’m required to do it the better I can become.</p>
