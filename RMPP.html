										<h3>Unit 1, Collaborative Discussion #1</h3>
										<p>For this assignment each student was tasked with choosing an example of unethical design practice and showing examples of ethical guidelines they violated.</p>
										<p>In my discussion I outlined the deceptive practices of 'Dark UX Patterns' and why they are unethical.</p>

							<h2>NSIM Design Proposal and Executive Summary</h2>
							<p>These were the two largest group tasks of the module.</p>
							<div class="items style1 big onscroll-fade-in">
								<section>
									<h3>Design Proposal</h3>
									<p>Working on the design proposal was a little rough at first. With the exception of Shiraj, the knowledge and skills needed to research and write the document were new to us. With his support, we were able to complete our individual sections without too many roadblocks.</p>
									<p>I was responsible for researching and explaining possible security challenges and vulnerabilities. I had a passing familiarity with the most likely scenarios, but I needed to research more in depth to provide the level of detail required for the design document.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
									<p>The executive summary went much smoother. The work from the design document laid a solid foundation onto which we could create the executive summary. Shiraj laid out the vulnerabilities identified by the previous scans in an easy to understand way, which allowed the other sections to reference them naturally.</p>
									<p>My responsibility for the executive summary was to analyse the vulnerabilities found and recommend how they could be closed. Most of the vulnerabilities were related to outdated software, and could be fixed in several straightforward ways.</p>

							<h2>NSIM Individual Reflection</h2>
							<p>This module has been very useful and informative. While previous modules focused on security from a legal or theoretical standpoint, this was the first time for many of us that we had a chance to use various tools and scanning software to see how to analyze a server and website to see how it could be vulnerable to external attacks. It also helped a lot that this module is set up as a team class from the beginning. While each exercise individually could be completed as a single person, it was very helpful to have the chance to ask group members for help when I encountered any difficulties with the suite of tools at my disposal. Also, like all group projects, it helps to have group members with a variety of undergraduate backgrounds who can help each other on group assignments by filling in the gaps in each individual’s knowledge with their own set of skills and experiences. Unfortunately my knowledge of programming and computer science was overshadowed by Shiraj in this module, because he had specific hands-on experience with the penetration testing and scanning tools we used throughout the module. Thankfully I was still able to leverage my skills to help research and write the parts of the group assignments I was responsible for.</p>
							<p>Overall I feel confident in the work presented by both my individual contributions and the overall documents completed by my team. This module was longer than previous modules, and had more exercises and work to complete. This was even more apparent due to how busy myself and other team members were with other aspects of our lives outside of University. I think there are a few parts of the group documents and E-Portfolio that I could have improved upon. However, I also believe that given the time I had available and my understanding of the material presented that I contributed to the success of the team to the best of my ability. I know that some of the my other team members feel the same way about their sections of the design document and executive summary, which leads to an interesting conundrum where I feel that their contributions are just as high quality as I’ve come to expect from them from previous modules, and they might feel the same way about me. It’s therefore possible that all this worrying about our individual work is just a manifestation of each of us being our harshest critic.</p>
