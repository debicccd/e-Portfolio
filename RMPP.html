										<h3>Unit 1, Collaborative Discussion #1</h3>
										<p>For this assignment each student was tasked with choosing an example of unethical design practice and showing examples of ethical guidelines they violated.</p>
										<p>In my discussion I outlined the deceptive practices of 'Dark UX Patterns' and why they are unethical.</p>

								<section>
									<h3>Literature Review</h3>
									<p>For the literature review I was tasked with choosing a topic from a list of approved topics, then critically evaluating that topic by reading existing literature on the subject.</p>
									<p>Main objectives<br>
									   1. Provide an overview of current knowledge<br>
									   2. Demonstrate awareness<br>
									   3. Higlight similar and constrasting views</p>
									<p>The topic I choose to cover for my literature review was AI and machine learning in the field of assisting the physically disabled. I went over the history of AI and machine learning, the basics of how it works, and how it can be used to help those who are disabled. Many studies and research projects have already been performed on the topic, but there is a lot more room for the field to grow and improve.</p>

									<h3>Research Proposal Presentation</h3>
									<p>For this deliverable I was required to pick a topic and propose a research project to expand on that topic. This proposal would be delivered as a presentation and needed a visual component and an audio recording to acompany it.</p>
									<p>Main Objectives<br>
									   1. Knowledge of the topic and use of relevant sources<br>
									   2. Critical analysis of the topic<br>
									   3. Well-structured proposal<br>
									   4. Competently executed presentation</p>
									   <p>My topic of choice again involved AI and machine learning, but applied to the field of Cybersecurity. I proposed that the addition of machine learning could enhance the security and reliability of traditional biometric scanners. My research project would test this hypothesis by both modifying an existing biometric scanner with AI and by making a new software to track eye movement with machine learning.</p>
