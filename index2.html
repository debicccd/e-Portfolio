								<h2>NSIM Team Exercises</h2>
								<p>These are the hands-on learning assignments that we completed as a team. Some were divided up among each team member, others we attempted to complete induvidually and then discussed as a team to ensure a firm understanding of the learning objectives.</p>

										<h3>Unit 3, Scanning Exercise</h3>
										<p>Shiraj's knowledge and experience with scanning and penetration testing tools made him a key component for this exercise. When another team member ran into difficulty we would ask him for clarification.</p>
										<p>Each team member attempted the scans to learn more about the scanning tools, but Shiraj was tasked with performing the scans we would use for future exercises and documents.</p>

							<h2>NSIM Team Meetings</h2>
							<p>Regular meetings are an important part of any group project. Here is a quick overview of each meeting that occured during the NISM module.</p>
							<div class="items style1 big onscroll-fade-in">
								<section>
									<h3>Meeting 1, 7th May 2021</h3>
									<p>The focus of this meeting was the drafting and discussion of the Team Contract, which outlines the responsibilities and expectations of each team member. We were able to use our previous itertion of the Team Contract as a template, which allowed for a quick and easy acceptance of the new contract by all team members.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Meeting 2, 13th May 2021</h3>
									<p>This meeting marked the beginning of planning out the upcomming Design Document. We decided to leave the seperation of workload to next meeting, after we had a chance to run through the AWS Educate setup and had a better context of what was to be written.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Meeting 3, 20th May 2021</h3>
									<p>We discussed as a team the details of the penetration test and went more in depth to ensure we understood the methods and results. With this newfound knowledge we were able to divide up the Design Document sections between group members.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Meeting 4, 27th May 2021</h3>
									<p>We focused on discussing what each team member had researched and written for their respective section of the Design Document. Hearing what each member learned while working on their part ensures that all members also gain that knowledge going forward.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Meeting 5, 3rd June 2021</h3>
									<p>We talked breifly about the forum discussion and peer responses, but mainly focused on the Design Document. We made sure each member was on track to complete their section before the next team meeting so we could focus on proofreading and combining each member's individual contributions next week.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Meeting 6, 10th June 2021</h3>
									<p>The goal of this meeting was to have a finalized Deisgn Document ready for subission, ensuring we have ample time for proofreading before the dealine in a little over a week. We double checked the formatting and content, and also checked that we were within the word limits that were in place.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Meeting 7, 17th June 2021</h3>
									<p>For this meeting we brainstormed questions to ask during the open office session that took place the following day. After compiling the list of questions, we tasked each member to read over the requirements for the Executive Summary and think about which section they would like to be responsible for.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Meeting 8, 24th June 2021</h3>
									<p>We went over the Executive Summary sections as a group and assigned each section to a team member.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Meeting 9, 1st July 2021</h3>
									<p>Each team member went over the research they've accomplished for their section of the Executive Summary. Other members provided feedback	when they had previous experince with the subject.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Meeting 10, 8th July 2021</h3>
									<p>We further refined and discussed each section of the Executive Summary as we added detail and expanded our research.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Meeting 11, 15th July 2021</h3>
									<p>During this meeting we tried to integrate each member's section into a complete Executive Summary. We had a few problems because our original outline of where each section should fit together didn't quite flow as well as we expected. We decided to read and rearrange the sections over the next few days before submitting our final Executive Summary.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Meeting 12, 22nd July 2021</h3>
									<p>This meeting ended up not convining due to some scheduling conflicts and a lack of topics that require group discussion.</p>
